### What are the pros and cons of TDD?
#### Pros:
 - TDD forces your code to be more modular.
 - Helps create a good software architecture. Because the code is modularized, it can also be properly unit-tested.
 - Increases maintainability of code as it provides clarity during the implementation process.
 
 #### Cons:
 - The tests themselves may need to be maintained.
 - Can slow down intial development as software may not be ready initially.
 - Creating tests for failures can be tedious.
 - Will require getting used to, as most people are more familiar writing software the other way around (writing tests second).
